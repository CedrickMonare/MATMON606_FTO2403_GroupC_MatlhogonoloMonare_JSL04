In this coding exercise, I had to work with the Monster Ternary Operator. I used ternary operators to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks. In each challenge I had to use the ternary operator to decide between two options based on a certain condition, demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic and I had to use them where they made sense to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions. Overall I enjoyed this project as it wasn't too complex and improved my practical JavaScript experience.
